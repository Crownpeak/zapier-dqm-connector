# Zapier DQM Connector

## Overview
This repository provides a custom **Zapier integration** for the [Crownpeak DQM CMS API](https://developer.crownpeak.com/DQM/cms/index.html). It enables direct access to asset operations such as creation, retrieval, and spellcheck quality analysis within an Zapier workflow.

## What is it?
A Zapier integration designed to simplify integration with Crownpeak DQM's CMS API using secure and structured credential management. It supports:

- Authenticate securely using API key credentials.
- Manage assets end-to-end: create, update, delete, and fetch content and status.
- Inspect asset issues via spellcheck, page highlights, and checkpoint errors.
- Access checkpoint and website data with tailored workflows.
- Chain operations using dynamic expressions, building automated quality pipelines.

## What is it for?
This integration is useful for organizations using Crownpeak DQM who want to:

- Automate quality checks on web content
- Schedule or trigger DQM scans from CMS or DAM systems
- Include DQM analysis within broader content approval workflows
